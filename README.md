# AndroidCollegeProject

Final, individual capstone project for my Level 8, Higher Diploma in Computer Science (Software Development)
in DBS, Dublin Business School.

Developed in Xamarin C# and SQLite using Visual Studio - completion deadline Aug 24th 2018.

Application lets a currency trader download an xml file of weekly news market impacting news announcments from a 
brokerage site, store these in a SQLite database on their mobile device & then set alarms, alert & notifications accordingly.
The user can also set 'personal' alerts for times / events that aren't in the xml.
